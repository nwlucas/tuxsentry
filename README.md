# TuxSentry

An adventurous attempt to learn [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and 
[Websockets](https://www.websocket.org).


#### Why [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/)?

Because I wanted to learn functional programming. with experience with OO and Ruby this seemed like a good entry point.
YMMV

#### Why [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)?

Javascript frontends are not going anywhere and they do have some merits. The ecosystem has many to choose from but I 
need an easier entry without losing too much of the functionality


#### Why [Websockets](https://www.websocket.org)?

Attempting to do build an application that can seemingly communicate in real time between the backend and frontend,
without adding too many other tools to the stack.


Besides all of the above TuxSentry should be a non trivial application that intends to report metrics and other facts 
about the underlying host system and report in a nice human friendly gui that will be updated either by a pre-determined
time or via a button push without traditional page refresh.

The underlying system in time hopefully will be a fully functional port of [PSUtil](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil)
 and hopefully will support multiple host systems same as PSUtil.
 
Either way I hope to learn as much as I can as it is no cheap endeavor.



#### Where are the tests?

Yeah that is another thing I am learning along the way, so they will be added as soon I learn.
